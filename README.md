# Sudoku Solver
## Description
This is a program made in Windows Forms (.NET Framework) while I was studying the C# language. It's capable of generating valid sudokus, receive user input, check if they are valid, and also it is able to display its solution on screen.

## Functionalities
* __Generate valid sudokus__

* __Difficulty choice__ - The sudoku solver has 3 types of difficulties that can be chosen by the user: beginner, intermediate and advanced. Each difficulty is related to the initial amount of spaces filled, such that 45, 30, and 15 are the starting amounts for beginner, intermediate, and advanced, respectively.

* __Validate user inputs__ - Ability to check for user errors in their sudoku solution, and indicate them on screen.

* __Display current sudoku solution__ - Display solution for current sudoku.
